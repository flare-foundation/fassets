/**
 * IForbiddenAddressList interface — governed lists of addresses that value may not be accepted from or paid to
 * (sanctions screening). Any contract or verifier that must refuse such value reads them: FDC2 verifiers screening
 * the addresses of a proof, and on-chain consumers that check an address themselves.
 *
 * Two kinds of list:
 * - **One list per non-EVM source**, of address strings, named by the source's FDC source id (`BTC`, `testBTC`,
 *   `XRP`, `testXRP`). Each has its own entries, version and last-addition time, so an addition on one
 *   source never makes a verdict about another stale. An address is identified by its standard address hash,
 *   `keccak256(bytes(address))`, the FDC's convention, so it is held in the one canonical form the FDC hashes on its
 *   chain: Bitcoin Base58 as written and Bech32 in lowercase, a classic `r…` address on XRPL (never an X-address)
 *   (`isCanonicalAddress`), refusing any other spelling on addition and on a check by
 *   string (`NonCanonicalAddress`), so a second spelling can neither be listed nor pass a check as clean. Checks are
 *   by hash (`isForbiddenHash`), for a hash an FDC proof reports, or by string (`isForbidden`).
 *   The list serves one external network for the whole deployment (`getNetwork`):
 *   the source id names the chain — `BTC` / `testBTC` Bitcoin, `XRP` / `testXRP` XRPL — and the network which of
 *   its address networks is valid (regtest on a Local deployment). A source id must name the deployment's kind of
 *   network (`SourceIds.fitsNetwork`: no `test` prefix on Mainnet, the prefix on Testnet,
 *   either on Local); every per-source call reverts `UnsupportedSourceId` for any other id — an EVM chain's, one the
 *   list has no rule for, one of the other network — so a consumer or verifier configured with a wrong id fails at
 *   once rather than reading an empty list as clean.
 * - **One EVM list**, of `address` values, for every EVM chain at once (Flare, Songbird, Ethereum, the test
 *   networks, …): an EVM address is the same holder on all of them, and an `address` has a single value, so there is
 *   no form to get wrong (`isForbiddenEvmAddress`). EVM addresses are never added to a source's string list.
 *
 * **Personal Accounts.** A source may have a Personal Account provider (`getPersonalAccountProvider`, a smart-account
 * controller, set by governance with its timelock): whenever an address is newly added to the source's list, the list
 * asks the provider for the Personal Account that address owns (`IPersonalAccountProvider.getPersonalAccount`, a
 * deterministic address, deployed or not) and lists it on the EVM list in the same call, so a listed owner's smart
 * account is listed with it (`PersonalAccountDerived`). The provider is a governed contract trusted to answer: if
 * it reverts, so does the addition. A repeated address is skipped with its derivation; a removal never cascades — an
 * owner and its Personal Account are removed by governance one by one.
 *
 * Addresses are added by a maintainer — one of a set governance keeps, typically compliance multisigs smaller than
 * governance, so that an addition reaches the chain quickly — or by governance; adding freezes value and moves none.
 * Only governance removes, with its timelock: removing releases value.
 *
 * Every list has a version, raised by every call that changes it. A reader pages through it
 * (`getForbiddenAddressHashes`, `getForbiddenAddresses`, `getForbiddenEvmAddresses`) and compares the version every
 * page returns: the same version on every page is one consistent list; a different one means it changed while it was
 * read, and the reader starts again. Removal moves the last entry into the removed one's place, so the order is not
 * the insertion order.
